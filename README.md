I am a big soccer fan. This full-stack JavaScript web app is designed to let the user build his own soccer team.  
The user has to select 18 players among thousands of real-world soccer players.  
And the user can set his customized formation like 442, 433 or 343.  
# Technology involved  
Angular, Express, MongoDB, NodeJs  
Then this team can join tournaments or friendly matches with some greatest clubs in the world like Barcelona, Real Madrid.

2. Open packs  
User will have 18 packs, 16 regular players packs and 2 goalkeepers packs.  
The system will generate 5 random players at a time and let the user choose one of them.  
User should consider the balance of a real soccer team.  
You donâ€™t want to build a team with 10 attackers and no defenders.
